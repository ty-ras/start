The Typesafe REST API Specification is a family of libraries used to enable seamless development of Backend and/or Frontend which communicate via HTTP protocol.
The protocol specification is checked both at compile-time and run-time to verify that communication indeed adhers to the protocol.
This all is done in such way that it does not make development tedious or boring, but instead robust and fun!

This particular repository contains libraries related to managing TyRAS itself.
- [start](./start) folder holds code for the package which can be used to set up a template for new TyRAS projects.
